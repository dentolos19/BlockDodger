# Dodge The Blocks: Blue Power Core [![Code Quality](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d843779ccc76494b9a9bbd11b8da3b1c)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/dentolos19/DodgeTheBlocks?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=dentolos19/DodgeTheBlocks&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

A simple block dodging game based on Brackeys! I recreated and published this game on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aprodots.dodgetheblock) and it is the first one to be published by me, and it was all for the learning experience! Quick start, If you're on PC (any OS) then you can play the game [here](https://dentolos19.github.io/DodgeTheBlocks); but if you're on Android, then you can play the game by downloading [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aprodots.dodgetheblock), iOS **will** not be supported any time soon. If you find any issues or bugs please report them [here](https://github.com/dentolos19/DodgeTheBlocks/issues). Any contributions to this project will be much help, thanks!

This is a simple block dodging game based on Brackeys! This is just for the learning experience and I've published this game on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aprodots.dodgetheblock), it is the first one that I've created which is already published. It's only available on Android, and I do not plan to support iOS soon because of other reasons, but for quick players you can play it right now [here](https://dentolos19.github.io/play/dodgetheblocks). If you find any issues or bugs please report them [here](https://github.com/dentolos19/DodgeTheBlocks/issues).
