# Dodge The Blocks: Blue Power Core [![Code Quality](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d843779ccc76494b9a9bbd11b8da3b1c)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/dentolos19/DodgeTheBlocks?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=dentolos19/DodgeTheBlocks&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is a simple block dodging game based on Brackeys! This is just for the learning experience and I've published this game on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aprodots.dodgetheblock), it is the first one that I've created which is already published. It's only available on Android, and I do not plan to support iOS soon because of other reasons, but for quick players you can play it right now [here](https://dentolos19.github.io/play/dodgetheblocks). If you find any issues or bugs please report them [here](https://github.com/dentolos19/DodgeTheBlocks/issues).
